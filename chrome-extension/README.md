Creating a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to enter a keyword, city, state, and state. And integrates with a Node.js API backend endpoint that runs a Python script.

This plan outlines the steps and timelines for building the Chrome extension, integrating it with your Node.js backend, and ensuring the proper implementation of project management principles. 

### Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Chrome Extension for Location-Based Keyword Business Search
- **Project Description**: This project aims to build a Chrome extension that allows users to input a keyword, city, and state to find related businesses using Google Maps. The extension will send these details to a Node.js backend for further processing.
- **Project Scope**: The project involves creating the Chrome extension, setting up the Node.js backend with Python integration, and ensuring secure communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Objectives**: The main objective is to create a fully functional Chrome extension that interacts with a backend to process user inputs and provide meaningful results.
- **Success Metrics**: Success will be measured by the extension's usability, its correct interaction with the backend, and the ability to process and return results reliably.

### Shaping
1. **The Problem**: Users need a Chrome extension to search for businesses based on specific inputs (keyword, city, and state).
2. **Outline the Solution**: 
   - Create a Chrome extension with a popup where users can input their data.
   - Connect the extension to a Node.js backend for processing.
   - Download the results as a CSV file
3. **Identify Risks and Assumptions**: 
   - Risk of CORS issues when connecting the extension to the backend.
   - Assumption that the Google Maps API key is valid and has sufficient permissions.
4. **Determine Resources and Tools**: 
   - Chrome Extension development environment (Glitch, Replit, etc.).
   - Node.js and Python for backend development.
   - Where to deploy the nodeJS backend (Replit, glitch, railway, vercel, and render)
   - Potentially Google Maps API for querying location data.

### Betting
1. **Project Feasibility**: Given the scope and complexity, this project is feasible with the current resources and time constraints.
2. **Determine Project Priorities**: The main priority is to create the extension and ensure proper communication with the backend.
3. **Confirm Commitment**: Confirm readiness to commit to the project for the full cycle.

### Building
1. **Cycle Length**: Consider a 6-week cycle for this project, with flexibility for adjustments.
2. **Milestones**:
   
   [ ] **Milestone 1**: Develop the Chrome extension structure and basic functionality. Create icons (16*16px , 48*48px and 128*128px)
   
   [ ] **Milestone 2**: Set up and deploy the Node.js backend with Python integration. Add permissiosn e.g network access, CORS, to maifest.js
   
   [ ] **Milestone 3**: Connect the extension to the backend and test communication. Add error handling.  Add error handling. Add service worker for any background tasks.
   
   [ ] **Milestone 4**: Implement auth integration and test queries. Secure the API (HTTPS, rate limiting, auth, protect sensitive data)
   
   [ ] **Milestone 5**: Conduct comprehensive testing and quality assurance. Compliance and security
   
   [ ] **Milestone 6**: Finalize the extension for deployment.

3. **Timeline**:
   - **Weeks 1-2**: Develop the Chrome extension structure and basic functionality. Create icons (16*16px , 48*48px and 128*128px)
   - **Weeks 1-2**: Set up and deploy the Node.js backend and integrate the Python script. Add permissiosn e.g network access, CORS, to maifest.js
   - **Week 3**: Test communication between the extension and the backend. Add error handling. Add service worker for any background tasks.
   - **Week 4-6**: Integrate auth if necessesary, conduct quality assurance, and finalize the extension. Secure the API (HTTPS, rate limiting, auth, protect sensitive data). Ensure app is compliant with Google policies regarding permissions and data privacy. Secure user-data storage and privacy regulations

4. **Work Process**:
   - **Task Management**: Use github to track progress.
   - **Regular Check-Ins**: Schedule daily or weekly check-ins to monitor progress.

5. **Hill Charts**: Create a visual representation of the project's progress, showing the uphill phase (solving uncertainties) and the downhill phase (implementation and completion).

6. **Quality Assurance**: Test the extension for functionality, usability, and interaction with the backend.

### Cool-Down
1. **Reflect on the Project**: After completing the cycle, reflect on what worked well and what could be improved.
2. **Address Technical Debt**: Use this time to fix issues, refactor code, or improve processes.
3. **Plan for the Next Cycle**: Start shaping the next project based on insights gained from this cycle.

### Communication and Documentation
- **Documentation**: Document your project plan, progress, and any relevant decisions.
- **Regular Updates**: Maintain discipline with regular updates and progress tracking.
